Percent Change
--------------

This is an Alfred Workflow to help you do percentage calculations. You can see
some background info on the original [forum post](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/4731-percent-change/),
or you can download this from [packal](http://www.packal.org/workflow/percent-change).

The supported calculations include:

1. *Percent Change* (increase/decrease): `% 3 6` gives you 100%.
2. *(Portion) Of*; 3 is what percent of 100: `% 3 of 100` gives you 3.
3. *Percent Difference*; What is 2 percent from 100: `% 100 - 2%` gives you 98.
4. *Percent Increase*; What is 100 + 2%: `% 100 + 2%` gives you 102.
